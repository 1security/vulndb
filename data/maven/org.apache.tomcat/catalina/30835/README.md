## Overview
[`org.apache.tomcat:catalina`](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22catalina%22)
The HTTP Digest Access Authentication implementation in Apache Tomcat 5.5.x before 5.5.34, 6.x before 6.0.33, and 7.x before 7.0.12 does not check qop values, which might allow remote attackers to bypass intended integrity-protection requirements via a qop=auth value, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-1184.
